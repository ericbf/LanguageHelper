# Language Helper

This is an android application that takes a host and port number, creates a socket connection to that address, and then streams audio from the device mic to that address.

It is a companion app for a project for my CS Master's program.

## To Run

Simply open the project in android studio and run on a device. It won't work in simulators because the simulator doesn't implement the mic classes.
